# Custom Android firmware :robot:

---

***Hi my name is Josh, I use a custom ROM on a daily basis and I have always wanted to know what it was like actually making one. So I am doing that!***

## Goals :football:

- Learn plenty of new skills in programming and design :man_technologist: and hopefully :crossed_fingers: even make something usable :iphone:

- To co-oparate :handshake:

- And primarily have fun :partying_face:
